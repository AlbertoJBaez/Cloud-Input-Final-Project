# Cloud input 

The aim of this repository is to showcase the Cloud team's input for The Bridge's final bootcamp project in August 2023.

  - Building a scalable, secure and efficient cloud architecture design for automation systems.

  - Automatic version synchronization and continuous systems and application deployment.


## Technical requirements of the project

- *Select the Cloud account associated with the project group*. Find a way to get free for the duration of the crew challenge.

- *Establish the team members who will have access to the project*. Create access levels and resource allocation.

- *Cloud infrastructure deployment: Design a cloud infrastructure using AWS, Azure or GCP services.* The architecture to be set up must be properly painted in the corresponding tools.

- *Infrastructure automation and management: The provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure should be automated.* This involves defining and deploying infrastructure as code (Infrastructure as Code) and using automation techniques to configure and update it.

- *Implementation of CI/CD pipelines:* Students must establish a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) flow. They must build an application that allows the automated construction and deployment of the developed application or services.

- *Define the CI architecture according to the type and language of the application to be developed.*

- *Define the CD architecture according to the objective (Dev only, Dev and Prod).* Monitoring and log management: Implement a monitoring solution where developers can check the status of their deployed solution at all times.

- *Security and compliance:* Students must secure the infrastructure and application through good security practices so that it cannot be misused by elements outside the organisation or misused by elements within the organisation.
